Pyreye is a web application that aims to help people living in areas under high-risk of wildfires to stay safe. Current warning systems are not adequate so Pyreye uses multiple datasets from publicly available data and satellite imagery to estimate and predict areas with high risk of wild fire occurrences. Users can get accurate weather and fire risk information right at their fingertips.


Team members include: Maxim Van Duyne, Nithiin Kathiresan, Krish Agrawal and Anand Kuro Andengattil.
